## Introduction
This project explores and implements a multiple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable \(y\) and a set of independent variables (\(x1, x2, x3\)) and the time series to demonstrate predictive modeling and statistical evaluation techniques. The study focuses on evaluating the assumptions of linear regression, diagnosing the model's validity, and making predictions based on test data.

## Dataset Description
### Multiple Linear Regression
- **Source**: The dataset is synthetically generated for academic purposes.
- **Size**: 1000 rows and 4 variables.
- **Features**:
  - `y`: Target variable (dependent variable).
  - `x1`, `x2`: Continuous predictor variables.
  - `x3`: Categorical predictor variable with three levels (`A`, `B`, `C`).

The categorical variable (`x3`) was one-hot encoded into `x3_B` and `x3_C` to facilitate regression modeling.

### Time Series Analysis
- **Source**: The dataset is synthetically generated for academic purposes.
- **Size**: 401 time-indexed observations.
- **Features**:
  - Time-dependent variable for ARIMA modeling.
  - Converted to a stationary series using first-order differencing.


---

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To build a reliable multiple linear regression model.
2. To ensure the model satisfies the Gauss-Markov assumptions:
   - Linearity
   - Homoscedasticity
   - Independence of errors
   - No multicollinearity
   - Normality of residuals
3. Apply an ARIMA model to the time-series data for forecasting future values.
4. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of both models using performance metrics such as:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Relative Error

## Methodology
### Multiple Linear Regression
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigated the dataset for missing values, outliers, and data types.
   - Visualized relationships using a correlation heatmap and pair plots.
   - Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Outliers were identified using Z-score and IQR methods.
   - Outliers were retained or removed based on their impact on model performance.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Created an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model using the training data.
   - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% test partitions.

4. **Diagnostics**:
   - Performed a range of diagnostics to validate the Gauss-Markov assumptions:
     - **Residual vs. Fitted Values Plot**: To verify linearity.
     - **Scale-Location Plot**: To assess homoscedasticity.
     - **Q-Q Plot**: To check residual normality.
     - **Cookâ€™s Distance**: To identify influential observations.
     - **Breusch-Pagan Test**: To confirm homoscedasticity statistically.
     - **VIF Analysis and Condition Number**: To check multicollinearity.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated predictive performance on the test set using MAE and relative error metrics.

### Time Series Analysis
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Used `auto_arima()` to determine optimal model parameters.
   - Selected ARIMA(1,1,1) for forecasting.

2. **Model Validation**:
   - Conducted residual analysis to check for autocorrelation, normality, and heteroscedasticity.

3. **Forecasting**:
   - Forecasted 81 future periods using the ARIMA(1,1,1) model.

## Results
### Multiple Linear Regression
- **R-squared**: The model explains 65% of the variance in the target variable.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and multicollinearity requirements were satisfied.
  - Minor deviations from normality in the residuals were detected but deemed acceptable due to the large sample size.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 911.53.
  - **Relative MAE (Mean)**: 5.92%.
  - **Relative MAE (Range)**: 7.63%.
  
Visualizations and diagnostics confirmed the model's validity and stability.

### Time Series Analysis
- **ARIMA(1,1,1) Model**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 6.656
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 3.1%
- **Diagnostics**:
  - No significant autocorrelation in residuals (Ljung-Box test, \(p > 0.05\)).
  - Forecasts aligned well with observed trends.

## Conclusion
This project successfully implemented a multiple linear regression model and a time series ARIMA model. The model demonstrated good predictive accuracy and adhered to the Gauss-Markov conditions. While slight deviations from residual normality were observed, they were not deemed significant enough to compromise model validity. The ARIMA model captured temporal patterns effectively, producing accurate short-term forecasts.

This project demonstrates the importance of diagnostics, cleaning, and model selection for statistical modeling and forecasting.

The analysis provides a solid framework for applying multiple linear regression in real-world scenarios.
